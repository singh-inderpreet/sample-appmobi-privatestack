## Introduction

Placeholder

## Purpose

By leveraging the [Apache Cordova* plug-ins](http://plugins.cordova.io/#/), you can develop compelling HTML5 hybrid apps for any platform and use case. [Apache Cordova](http://cordova.apache.org/) is a set of device APIs that allow a mobile app developer to access native device function such as the camera or accelerometer from JavaScript. Besides the standard APIs, various plug-ins are available in the [Apache Cordova Plug-ins Registry](http://plugins.cordova.io/#/) and located across the web on github. .

## Testing

**Emulator:** Does not support third party plugins. When testing third party plugins, the app must be built and tested on device.

**App Preview:** Does not support third party plugins. When testing third party plugins, the app must be built and tested on device.

**Built app:** This sample app only works on a built app as it uses third party plugins.
